# Branching Strategy

This repository follows a structured three-branch strategy to ensure smooth development, thorough testing, and stable production releases.

- **Dev Branch:**  
  This is the main development branch where new features, bug fixes, and experiments are implemented. All active development work is carried out here.

- **Test Branch:**  
  Once a feature is completed in the dev branch, a pull request is opened to merge the changes into the test branch. This branch is used for additional testing and validation to ensure that all features work as expected.

- **Master Branch:**  
  The master branch contains production-ready code. Only thoroughly tested and approved changes from the test branch are merged here. This branch reflects the stable state of the project.

This strategy helps maintain code quality and stability throughout the development lifecycle.
